## Overview
This project demonstrates an agentic AI orchestration system for strategic group discussions using multiple specialized agents. It leverages Azure OpenAI and the Semantic Kernel library to simulate a collaborative debate among domain experts, each represented as an autonomous agent. The orchestration is visualized through a Streamlit web interface.



## Key Features
- **Multiple AI Agents:** Each agent represents a specific role (Project Manager, SAP S/4HANA Consultant, Solution Architect, Business Analyst, Finance Manager, IT Strategic Leader) with unique instructions and expertise.
- **Group Chat Orchestration:** Agents interact in a structured group chat, managed by a custom group chat manager that guides the discussion, selects speakers, and determines when the conversation should end.
- **Azure OpenAI Integration:** Uses Azure OpenAI for agent responses, enabling advanced language understanding and reasoning.
- **Streamlit UI:** Provides an interactive web interface for users to input tasks, configure Azure settings, and view the evolving group conversation in real time.

## How It Works
1. **Configuration:**
   - Users enter Azure OpenAI deployment details (deployment name, API key, endpoint) in the sidebar.
   - Users specify a strategic task or question for the group to discuss.

2. **Agent Setup:**
   - The system creates six agents, each with a domain-specific role and instructions.
   - Agents are powered by Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel's agent abstractions.

3. **Orchestration:**
   - A custom `ChatCompletionGroupChatManager` manages the group chat, ensuring all agents participate, selecting the next speaker, and determining when the discussion is complete.
   - The manager uses prompt templates to guide agent behavior and conversation flow.

4. **Execution:**
   - When the user clicks "Run the analysis," the system starts the orchestration asynchronously.
   - Agents take turns responding to the task, with their messages animated in the UI.
   - The manager monitors the discussion, summarizes results, and provides a final output.

5. **Results:**
   - The full conversation is displayed in the Streamlit app.
   - A final summary and result are presented at the end.

## Example Use Case
- **SAP Master Data Hub Discussion:**
  - The default task asks agents to debate the onboarding of SAP Master Data Integration for a global master data hub.
  - Each agent contributes insights from their domain, leading to a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the App:**
   ```powershell
   streamlit run agenticdebate.py
   ```
3. **Configure Azure OpenAI:**
   - Enter your Azure deployment name, API key, and endpoint in the sidebar.
4. **Start a Discussion:**
   - Enter your strategic question or task and click "Run the analysis" to begin the group chat.

## File Structure
- `agenticdebate.py`: Main application code, including agent definitions, orchestration logic, and Streamlit UI.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Customization
- **Add/Modify Agents:**
  - Edit the `get_agents` function in `agenticdebate.py` to add new roles or change agent instructions.
- **Change Prompts:**
  - Update prompt templates in the `ChatCompletionGroupChatManager` class to adjust discussion flow or output style.
